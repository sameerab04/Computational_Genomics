# BIOSC 1542 - Computational_Genomics

Exploration of use of computer-aided methods to generate and test
biological hypotheses at whole-genome scales. Gain both a theoretical and
practical understanding of working with genomic data, with a focus on high-throughput
sequencing technologies. Highlights modern computational techniques and apply what they learn to a real-world research project.
